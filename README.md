# xamarin-scan-it-classic

Same as xamarin-scan-it, just an older version before I made some changes.

An Android app that allows you to take a picture / select from gallery of object. It will add crop handles and outline the largest rectangle.

Uses: -- Take a picture of a piece of paper and then crop the image.

This app was built with Xamarin and uses the EmguCV: OpenCV in .NET library. http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
